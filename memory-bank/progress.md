# Progress

- **What works**:
  - The core memory bank structure is initialized.
  - `activeContext.md` updated with all recent changes.
  - Frontend service files (`src/services/AuthApi.js`, `src/services/userService.js`, `src/admin/utils/api.js`) refactored/updated.
  - Authentication flow components and `AuthContext.js` reviewed and updated.
  - `src/components/common/Navbar.js`: Updated for admin link visibility and "Work Bag" feature.
  - `src/App.js`: Admin route guard updated and diagnostic logging added.
  - Admin pages have been restyled for a consistent and modern design.
  - The "Cart" feature has been replaced with a "Work Bag" feature.
  - A new enrollment flow has been implemented with the `EnrollNowModal`.
  - The `EnrollNowModal` now updates the user's profile and sends enrollment data to an Excel sheet.
  - The "Work Bag" icon is now visible in the mobile view.
  - The "Grant Access" form has been converted into a modal with improved styling and accessibility.
  - The job portal page now displays only 11 jobs and a promotional card.
  - The "Apply Now" button on the `JobCard` component now triggers the login modal if the user is not authenticated.

- **What's left to build (Current Task Focus)**:
  - **Investigate Infinite Loader**: Debug the component causing the infinite re-render loop and excessive API calls to `/connect/user/progress`.
  - **Backend Database Issue**: The primary blocker is a backend database error: `"type "enum_app_users_roles[]" does not exist"`.
  - **Frontend Alignment with Backend Refactor (Largely Complete for reviewed areas, pending backend fix)**:
    - User needs to integrate `ResetPasswordPage.js` and `OAuthCallbackPage.js` into the router.
    - User to test admin access and functionality **once the backend database issue is resolved.**
    - Verify other admin panel sections not explicitly covered.
    - Address remaining ESLint warnings for code quality and potential bug prevention.
    - Conduct thorough integration testing **once the backend database issue is resolved.**

- **Current status**:
  - Frontend logic for authentication, role checking, OAuth flows, admin dashboard stats, admin job/internship/application listings, detail views, analytics pages, and job/internship creation forms has been significantly revised to align with backend changes and fix reported errors.
  - The admin section has a consistent and modern design.
  - The "Work Bag" and enrollment flow have been implemented.
  - The job portal has been updated to limit the number of jobs displayed and include a promotional card.
  - **Currently blocked by a backend database schema issue (`"type "enum_app_users_roles[]" does not exist"`)**.

- **Known issues**:
  - **BLOCKER: Backend database error related to `enum_app_users_roles[]` type.**
  - A component is causing an infinite loader and repeated calls to the `/connect/user/progress` API endpoint.
  - Numerous ESLint warnings across the codebase still need attention.
  - The `handleSubmit` in `src/components/careers/JobApplicationForm.js` is a simulation.
  - Other admin panel sections (Content Management, Documents, Job Detail application list) may need review.

- **Evolution of project decisions**:
  - Aligned frontend with major backend refactoring.
  - Addressed issues related to admin access, OAuth, password reset, and React warnings/errors.
  - Consolidated admin application fetching logic and updated consuming components.
  - Fixed data processing errors in admin dashboard and analytics pages.
  - Improved client-side validation, payload mapping, and API response handling in job/internship creation forms.
  - Addressed several ESLint warnings in recently modified files.
  - Implemented a new "Work Bag" feature and enrollment flow.
  - Overhauled the UI of the admin section for a more consistent and modern design.
  - Updated the job portal to improve user engagement and drive internship registrations.
  - **Current efforts are paused pending resolution of a backend database schema error.**
