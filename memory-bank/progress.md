# Progress

- **What works**:
  - The core memory bank structure is initialized.
  - `activeContext.md` updated with all recent changes, including ESLint fixes and job/internship creation form updates.
  - Frontend service files (`src/services/AuthApi.js`, `src/services/userService.js`, `src/admin/utils/api.js`) refactored/updated.
    - `src/admin/utils/api.js`: Consolidated application fetching.
  - Authentication flow components and `AuthContext.js` reviewed and updated.
    - `src/admin/contexts/AdminContext.js`: Corrected `checkAdminAccess` function. Addressed ESLint warning for `useMemo` deps.
  - `src/components/common/Navbar.js`: Updated for admin link visibility.
  - `src/App.js`: Admin route guard updated and diagnostic logging added. Removed unused `useRef`.
  - `src/admin/pages/DashboardHome.js`: Addressed React key warning and updated for `applicationsByStatus` array.
  - `src/admin/pages/jobs/JobList.js` & `src/admin/pages/internships/InternshipList.js`: Updated for new flat pagination API response.
  - `src/admin/pages/applications/JobApplications.js` & `InternshipApplications.js`: Updated for consolidated API and new response structure.
  - `src/admin/pages/internships/InternshipDetail.js`: Updated for consolidated application API and new response structure. Cleaned up unused imports/variables.
  - `src/admin/pages/analytics/UserAnalyticsPage.js` & `JobAnalyticsPage.js`: Fixed `TypeError` by ensuring analytics data arrays default to empty arrays.
  - `src/admin/pages/jobs/JobCreate.js` & `src/admin/pages/internships/InternshipCreate.js`: Improved client-side validation, payload key mapping (camelCase to snake_case), and API response handling (to fix "undefined undefined" console error on success). Cleaned up unused function and ESLint issues in InternshipCreate.
  - `src/admin/components/common/DataTable.js`: Removed unused `Link` import and `handleSearch` function.
  - `src/admin/components/common/FormFields.js`: Removed unused `Form` import.
  - File upload field names updated.
  - Admin panel user management refactored.
  - `systemPatterns.md` updated.

- **What's left to build (Current Task Focus)**:
  - **Backend Database Issue**: The primary blocker is a backend database error: `"type "enum_app_users_roles[]" does not exist"`.
  - **Frontend Alignment with Backend Refactor (Largely Complete for reviewed areas, pending backend fix)**:
    - User needs to integrate `ResetPasswordPage.js` and `OAuthCallbackPage.js` into the router.
    - User to test admin access and functionality **once the backend database issue is resolved.**
    - Verify other admin panel sections not explicitly covered.
    - Address remaining ESLint warnings for code quality and potential bug prevention.
    - Conduct thorough integration testing **once the backend database issue is resolved.**

- **Current status**:
  - Frontend logic for authentication, role checking, OAuth flows, admin dashboard stats, admin job/internship/application listings, detail views, analytics pages, and job/internship creation forms has been significantly revised to align with backend changes and fix reported errors.
  - Several ESLint warnings for unused variables/imports and hook dependencies have been addressed in modified files.
  - **Currently blocked by a backend database schema issue (`"type "enum_app_users_roles[]" does not exist"`)**.

- **Known issues**:
  - **BLOCKER: Backend database error related to `enum_app_users_roles[]` type.**
  - Numerous ESLint warnings across the codebase still need attention.
  - The `handleSubmit` in `src/components/careers/JobApplicationForm.js` is a simulation.
  - Other admin panel sections (Content Management, Documents, Job Detail application list) may need review.

- **Evolution of project decisions**:
  - Aligned frontend with major backend refactoring.
  - Addressed issues related to admin access, OAuth, password reset, and React warnings/errors.
  - Consolidated admin application fetching logic and updated consuming components.
  - Fixed data processing errors in admin dashboard and analytics pages.
  - Improved client-side validation, payload mapping, and API response handling in job/internship creation forms.
  - Addressed several ESLint warnings in recently modified files.
  - **Current efforts are paused pending resolution of a backend database schema error.**
